# Croeso / Welcome

I'm Jack, a computer engineer from Wales with specialisations in robotics, embedded systems, and software engineering.

My personal projects on GitHub include robot software, firmware, Linux and Windows desktop applications, Discord bots, and more.

## Professional Background

I have a BSc undergraduate degree in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence, which included a standard computer science curriculum (e.g. data structures and algorithms). I also have a MSc postgraduate degree in Advanced Computer Science.

I have some industry experience working as a software engineer in the defence sector, working in a research & development context. As part of this, I've delivered high-quality code that complies with critical safety standards (e.g. MISRA) and various military specifications (e.g. GVA; DEF STAN 23-009). My industry experience also includes agile processes like Scrum and SAFe.

## Skills

I often work with Bash, C, C++, Linux, and ROS, though I have a very diverse skillset.

I'm familiar with C#, HTML & CSS, Java, JavaScript, PowerShell, Python, and SQL.

I've worked with Arduino, Azure DevOps, CMake, DDS communication, Git, YARP (Yet Another Robotics Platform), and SQLite among various other tools and technologies.

I'm also familiar with Windows development, having worked with various Windows technologies including Command Prompt and Batch scripting, PowerShell, .NET and WPF applicatiins.

I've used a range of testing suites and tools, including CppUTest, Google Test (gtest), JUnit, and Parasoft, along with various self-made or specialised solutions.

I like working on all aspects of the software engineering process and I particularly enjoy design and documentation. A fair bit of my work features UML to communicate overview information, often done with PlantUML.
