# Croeso / Welcome

I'm Jack, a computer engineer from Wales with specialisations in robotics, embedded systems, and software engineering.

My personal projects on GitHub include robot software, firmware, Linux and Windows desktop applications, Discord bots, and more.

## Professional Background

I have a BSc undergraduate degree in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence, which included a standard computer science curruculum (e.g. DSA). I also have a MSc postgraduate degree in Advanced Computer Science.

I have some industry experience working as a software engineer in the defence sector, working in a research & development context. As part of this, I've delivered high-quality code that complies with critical safety standards (e.g. MISRA) and various military specifications (e.g. DEF STAN 23-009). My industry experience also includes agile processes like Scrum and SAFe.

## Skills

I often work with Bash, C, C++, Linux, and ROS, though I have a very diverse skillset.

I'm familiar with C#, HTML & CSS, Java, JavaScript, PowerShell, Python, and SQL.

I've worked with Arduino, Azure DevOps, CMake, DDS communication, Git, YARP (Yet Another Robotics Platform), SQLite, and the Windows Command Prompt (cmd.exe, plus batch scripting), among various other tools and technologies.

I'm also familiar with Windows, including as a development environment. I've used a range of testing suites and tools, including CppUTest, Google Test (gtest), JUnit, and Parasoft, along with various self-made or specialised solutions.

I've also worked with a variety of software design, process, and documentation tools and I (unironically) love writing documentation. I enjoy working with UML too.
