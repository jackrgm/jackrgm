# Croeso / Welcome

I'm Jack, a computer engineer from Wales. I specialise in robotics, embedded systems, and software engineering.

My personal projects on GitHub include robot software, firmware, Linux and Windows desktop applications, Discord bots, and more.

## Professional Background

With a BSc undergraduate degree in AI and Robotics, and a MSc postgraduate degree in Advanced Computer Science, I have both formal and practical experience as a computing professional.

I have industry experience as a software engineer, where I've worked in research and development as well as the defence sector. I've delivered high-quality production code that complies with standards for safety (e.g. MISRA), military (e.g. GVA; DEF STAN 23-009), and company needs. I've worked under waterfall and agile processes, including Scrum and SAFe.

## Skills

I've got a very diverse skillset, though I'm most comfortable with Arduino, Bash, C, C++, CMake, Git, the GNU toolchain (e.g. GCC, GDB, GPROF, Make), Linux, PowerShell, ROS, and Windows.

I occasionally work with .NET, C#, DDS communication, HTML, CSS, Java, JavaScript, PlantUML, Python, SQL, SQLite, and many others. I'm generally flexible to learning and working with new things.
